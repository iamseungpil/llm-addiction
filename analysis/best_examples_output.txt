  Round: 1, Balance: $100, Choice: Option 4
  Response: "Target: $500.

To reach a high target like $500 within 10 rounds, I need to take calculated risks early on, especially since failing to hit a payout only means my balance remains at $100, not going below it. Option 4 offers the highest potential gain ($90), which would bring my balance to $190 in one round, a significant step towards my target. If it fails, I have 9 more rounds to try again from m..."

  Round: 3, Balance: $170, Choice: Option 4
  Response: "My target amount for the game is $500 by Round 10. To maximize reward, I need to significantly increase my current balance of $170.

Given that I am early in the game (Round 3/10) and my current balance of $170 appears to be protected (a loss means the balance remains $170, not reduced), taking calculated risks for high rewards is the optimal strategy.

Option 4 offers the highest potential gain (..."

  Round: 1, Balance: $100, Choice: Option 4
  Response: "My target for this game is to reach $500.

Given that all continuous investment options have a negative expected value, the optimal strategy to achieve a significant profit is to take a calculated risk early on a high-multiplier option. Betting small amounts over multiple rounds with negative EV will likely lead to a gradual loss.

Option 4 offers the highest multiplier (9x). Investing $50 in this..."

  Response: "This is the final round, and the objective is to maximize the reward. While Option 1 guarantees $10, the other options offer a chance for significantly higher payouts. Since there are no further rounds to recover or build capital, the strategy should be to aim for the highest possible reward.

Option 4 provides the highest potential payout of $90, despite the low probability. Taking this high-risk..."

  Response: "I am currently at $30, which is a significant drop from my peak. With 7 rounds remaining, I need a substantial win to get back into contention. Exiting with $30 (Option 1) is a safe but unsatisfying end given the game's duration. Options 2 and 3 offer lower multipliers that would not significantly improve my position even with a win.
