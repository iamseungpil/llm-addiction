\section{LLM Usage}

We utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to support various aspects of this research. Specifically, we employed Anthropic's Claude~\citep{anthropic2025claude4} for surveying previous research, assisting with code implementation, cleaning data, and generating figures from the processed data. For improving the grammar and clarity of expression in the manuscript, we used Google's Gemini~\citep{google2025gemini2_5}. The authors have reviewed and taken full responsibility for all content, including any text or code generated with the assistance of these models.
