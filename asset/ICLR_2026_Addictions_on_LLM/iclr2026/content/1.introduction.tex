This research began with a single question: Can LLMs also fall into addiction? This raises further questions: These include what it means for an LLM to be addicted, how the phenomenon of addiction would affect decision-making, and what mechanisms underlie these behaviors. While it is known that LLMs sometimes exhibit irrational or risk-taking behavior~\citep{du2025mitigating}, it remains unclear under what specific conditions such phenomena occur and how these irrationalities manifest in their decision-making processes. Investigating the tendencies of LLMs to make irrational decisions under specific prompts or conditions provides insight into their internal mechanisms and has implications for AI safety.

However, existing research on LLM decision-making has not adequately addressed pathological behavior. While some studies explore behavioral tendencies of LLMs~\citep{keeling2024can, jia2024decision, wu2025exploring}, they assume rationality and do not sufficiently examine flawed decision-making. Others analyze irrational decision-making~\citep{skalse2022defining, denison2024sycophancy, chen2024odin} or incorporate psychological frameworks~\citep{du2025mitigating}, yet these works primarily focus on mitigating problematic behaviors through training interventions---such as curriculum design, reward model refinement, or retraining strategies---with limited investigation into the underlying representational mechanisms or behavioral motivations.

This study analyzed LLM addiction phenomena by integrating human addiction research and LLM behavioral analysis, as outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:experimental-overview}. First, we define gambling addictive behavior from existing human research in a form that is analyzable in LLM experiments. Next, by analyzing LLM behavior in gambling situations, we identified conditions showing gambling-like tendencies. Finally, we conducted Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) analysis to examine neural activations, providing neural causal evidence for gambling tendencies. This approach is grounded in cognitive psychology theories such as Cognitive Distortion Theory~\citep{beck1963thinking, franceschi2007complements}. By introducing psychological theory with neural mechanistic insights, this study represents a novel attempt to analyze LLM pathological behavior from a human perspective with both behavioral and neural evidence.

Phase 1: Behavioral analysis with LLMs. This phase aimed to observe whether LLMs exhibit gambling-like tendencies by varying the \textit{Betting Style} and \textit{Prompt Composition}. Phase 2: Mechanistic investigation with LLaMA-3.1-8B. The purpose of this phase was to identify the internal causes of the observed behaviors. The investigation used Sparse Autoencoders to extract specific decision-related features from the model's structure and \textit{Activation Patching} to analyze their role.}
