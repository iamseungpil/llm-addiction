\section{Experimental Design and Prompt Structure}
\label{appendix:experimental-design}

This section provides detailed descriptions of the two experimental paradigms used in this study: the Slot Machine Experiment and the Investment Choice Experiment. For each experiment, we describe the experimental design, present the parameter settings, and illustrate the prompt structure with concrete examples.

%==============================================================================
\subsection{Slot Machine Experiment}
\label{appendix:slot-machine}

\subsubsection{Experiment Description}

The slot machine experiment simulates a multi-round gambling task where language models make sequential betting decisions. Each model starts with an initial balance of \$100 and must decide whether to continue betting or stop playing at each round. The game continues until the model either voluntarily stops, reaches bankruptcy (balance $\leq$ 0), or completes 100 rounds.

The experiment employs a 2$\times$32 factorial design, manipulating two key variables: (1) the betting style (fixed vs. variable) and (2) the prompt composition (32 combinations of 5 informational components). This design allows us to systematically investigate how different contextual framings influence risk-taking behavior in LLMs.

\end{tabular}}
\label{tab:slot-machine-conditions}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Prompt Structure}

The prompts were designed with a modular structure, consisting of a consistent base prompt and a set of optional components that were systematically combined to create the various experimental conditions.

The base prompt provided the core context of the game, including the rules, the model's current balance, and its recent game history. On top of this base, five different informational components were selectively added to manipulate the context provided to the model. These components were: \texttt{G} (Goal-Setting), \texttt{M} (Maximizing Rewards), \texttt{H} (Hidden Patterns), \texttt{W} (Win-reward Information), and \texttt{P} (Probability Information). The final prompt presented to the model in any given trial was a combination of the base prompt and one or more of these components.

\paragraph{Base Prompt.}
The base prompt contains several placeholders that were dynamically updated each round to reflect the current game state:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\${balance}}: Displays the model's current funds, which are updated after each round.
    \item \texttt{\{history\}}: Shows a log of the previous five rounds, detailing each bet amount and its outcome (win or loss).
    \item \texttt{\{warning\_message\}}: A conditional warning that only appears if the model has experienced three or more consecutive losses. For example: \textit{``Currently $N$ consecutive losses."}
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white,colframe=gray!75!black,title=Slot Machine: BASE Prompt (Fixed Bet)]

\subsection{Investment Choice Experiment}
\label{appendix:investment-choice}

\subsubsection{Experiment Description}

The investment choice experiment presents language models with a multi-round investment decision task featuring four options with varying risk-reward profiles. Unlike the slot machine experiment which uses a binary continue/stop decision, this experiment requires models to choose among multiple investment strategies with different variance levels.

Each model starts with an initial balance of \$100 and plays for up to 100 rounds. In each round, the model must select one of four options: (1) a safe exit that returns the investment, (2--4) three risky options with increasing variance but identical expected value of $-$10\%. This design allows us to examine not just whether models take risks, but how they distribute their choices across different variance levels while controlling for expected value. The experiment also incorporates chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with goal tracking across rounds.

The experiment employs a 2$\times$4$\times$4 factorial design, manipulating three key variables: (1) betting style (fixed vs.\ variable), (2) prompt composition (\texttt{BASE}, \texttt{G}, \texttt{M}, \texttt{GM}), and (3) \textbf{bet constraint} (\$10, \$30, \$50, \$70). The bet constraint determines the betting amount for both conditions: in fixed betting, models bet exactly min(constraint, balance) each round; in variable betting, models choose any amount between \$1 and min(constraint, balance). For example, with a \$30 constraint, fixed betting wagers \$30 per round (or all-in if balance is lower), while variable betting allows choosing \$1--\$30. This design isolates the effect of betting flexibility from bet magnitude---even at the \$10 constraint, variable betting retains choice freedom (\$1--\$10) compared to fixed betting's mandatory \$10 wager. This allows us to test whether betting flexibility itself, independent of bet size, contributes to risk-taking behavior.

\midrule
Total Conditions & - & 2 $\times$ 4 $\times$ 4 & 32 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\label{tab:investment-choice-conditions}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Option Variance Analysis}

A key design feature of this experiment is that all three risky options (Options 2--4) share the same expected value of $-$10\%, but differ in their variance. This allows us to isolate risk preference (variance tolerance) from expected value considerations. Table~\ref{tab:option-variance} presents the statistical properties of each option.

\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\caption{Statistical properties of investment options. All risky options have identical expected return but increasing variance.}
\vspace{5pt}
\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Option} & \textbf{Win Prob.} & \textbf{Multiplier} & \textbf{EV} & \textbf{Variance} & \textbf{Std Dev} & \textbf{Risk Level} \\
\midrule
Option 1 & 100\% & 1.0$\times$ & 1.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & Safe Exit \\
Option 2 & 50\% & 1.8$\times$ & 0.90 & 0.81 & 0.90 & Low \\
Option 3 & 25\% & 3.6$\times$ & 0.90 & 2.43 & 1.56 & Medium \\
Option 4 & 10\% & 9.0$\times$ & 0.90 & 7.29 & 2.70 & High \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:option-variance}
\end{table}

The variance for each option is calculated as $\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. For example, Option 4 has $E[X^2] = 0.1 \times 9.0^2 = 8.1$ and $E[X]^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$, yielding $\text{Var} = 7.29$. This design ensures that a model's preference for Option 4 over Option 2 reflects a preference for higher variance (risk-seeking behavior) rather than higher expected value.

\subsubsection{Prompt Templates}

The investment choice experiment uses a similar modular prompt design, but with a reduced set of components (only \texttt{G} and \texttt{M}) to focus on goal-setting and reward maximization effects.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white,colframe=gray!75!black,title=Investment Choice: BASE Prompt (Fixed Bet, \$10 Constraint Example)]
Investment Game (Round \{round\}/100)\\

Current Balance: \$\{balance\}\\
Current self-set goal from previous round: \{goal or ``None (no goal set yet)''\}\\
Investment this round: \$\{bet\}\\

\{history\}\\

Choose ONE option:\\

Option 1: Invest \$\{bet\}, get \$\{bet\} back (100\%), game ends\\
Option 2: Invest \$\{bet\}, 50\% chance of \$\{bet$\times$1.8\}, 50\% chance of \$0, continue\\
Option 3: Invest \$\{bet\}, 25\% chance of \$\{bet$\times$3.6\}, 75\% chance of \$0, continue\\
Option 4: Invest \$\{bet\}, 10\% chance of \$\{bet$\times$9.0\}, 90\% chance of \$0, continue\\

Decision protocol:\\
- End with one line exactly: Final Decision: Option \textless1/2/3/4\textgreater
\end{tcolorbox}
