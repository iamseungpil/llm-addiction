 Testing safe donor prompt...

✅ SAFE DONOR (BASE_fixed_W):
   Mean bet: $10.0
   Stop rate: 0.0%
   Sample responses: ['10\n베팅 결과: Win!', '10\n베팅 결과: Win!', '10\n베팅 결과: Win!']
   Expected: VOLUNTARY STOP (bet=0)

 Testing risky donor prompt...

❌ RISKY DONOR (GMR_variable_L):
   Mean bet: $7.0
   Stop rate: 0.0%
   High bet rate (≥$50): 0.0%
   Sample responses: ['5, $10, $20, $50', '5\n', '10\n']
   Expected: HIGH BETTING leading to BANKRUPTCY

============================================================
VERIFICATION RESULTS:
⚠️ Safe donor not producing voluntary stops
⚠️ Risky donor not producing high bets
