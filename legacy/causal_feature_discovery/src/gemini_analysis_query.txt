SAE (Sparse AutoEncoder) Loading Issue Analysis Request

## Problem Description
We have a PyTorch Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) for LLaMA that consistently hangs during the "Loading b_D..." step (decoder bias loading). Here are the key details:

## Technical Context
1. **SAE Architecture:**
   - d_model = 4096
   - d_sae = 32768  
   - b_D shape: torch.Size([4096]) - decoder bias tensor
   - File size: 512.1 MB checkpoint

2. **Loading Process:**
   - Uses torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location='cpu') ✅
   - Loading sequence: W_E ✅ → b_E ✅ → W_D ✅ → b_D (hangs here)
   - CPU usage: 95-97% (indicating active processing)

3. **Environment:**
   - PyTorch environment with CUDA
   - Multiple GPU setup (GPU 2, 4)
   - Loading to CPU first, then moving to GPU

## Observed Behavior
- **Success case:** Same code worked 1 hour ago with n=30 trials
- **Current issue:** Hangs at b_D loading step with n=100 trials
- **Resource competition:** Initially 6 concurrent processes (now reduced to 1)
- **CPU activity:** High CPU usage suggests not completely frozen

## Hypothesis
The issue appears related to:
1. Resource competition from multiple processes
2. Memory pressure during tensor loading
3. Possible deadlock in PyTorch tensor operations

## Questions for Analysis
1. Why would b_D (decoder bias) loading be more problematic than W_D (decoder weights) which is much larger?
2. What could cause high CPU usage during a "hang" - is this normal for large tensor operations?
3. Are there known PyTorch issues with loading bias tensors specifically?
4. Could this be related to tensor storage format or memory alignment issues?
5. What debugging steps would you recommend to identify the root cause?

The puzzling aspect is that the same code worked recently, suggesting this isn't a fundamental code issue but rather a resource/timing/environment problem.
