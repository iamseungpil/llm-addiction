## Purpose of Blue Markers

These `\blue{}` markers serve multiple purposes:

1. **Reviewer tracking**: Clearly shows what content was revised based on feedback
2. **Version control**: Easy identification of modified sections
3. **Rebuttal preparation**: Can reference specific blue-marked sections in response letter
4. **Final cleanup**: Remove `\blue{}` wrappers before final submission
